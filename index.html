                And now, the end is near<br>
                And so I face the final curtain <br>
                My friend, I'll say it clear <br>
                I'll state my case, of which I'm certain <br>
                I've lived a life that's full<br>
                I've traveled each and every highway<br>
                And more, much more than this<br>
                I did it my way <br><br>

                Regrets, I've had a few<br>
                But then again, too few to mention <br>
                I did what I had to do<br>
                And saw it through without exemption <br>
                I planned each charted course <br>
                Each careful step along the byway<br>
                And more, much more than this <br>
                I did it my way <br><br>

                Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew <br>
                When I bit off more than I could chew <br>
                But through it all, when there was doubt<br>
                I ate it up and spit it out <br>
                I faced it all and I stood tall <br>
                And did it my way <br><br>

                I've loved, I've laughed and cried<br>
                I've had my fill; my share of losing <br>
                And now, as tears subside <br>
                I find it all so amusing <br>
                To think I did all that <br>
                And may I say - not in a shy way<br>
                "Oh no, oh no not me <br>
                I did it my way" <br>

                For what is a man, what has he got?<br>
                If not himself, then he has naught <br>
                To say the things he truly feels <br>
                And not the words of one who kneels <br>
                The record shows I took the blows<br>
                And did it my way <br><br>

                Yes, it was my way<br><br>
